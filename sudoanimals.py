# CODE MADE BY BETTYE TAYLOR 
# TIME TO COMPLETE PROJECT: 20-35 Minutes 

# Simple Math Program in python 
# Change thr values to get differnt numbers 
cat = 20 + 20
dog = 30/20
fish = 30/cat
print(cat-fish+dog)
# Cat, dog, and fish are values that can be chnaged in this program You can add more animals to this list to come up with differnt outcomes. 
# These values are know as 'constants' and are often set values used  for non-changeable values for the user. However we can change these values.
